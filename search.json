    "text": "1.9 Named Ranges\nNamed ranges in Excel are like shortcuts for your data. They allow you to assign a meaningful name to a specific cell or range of cells, making it easier to reference them throughout your workbook. This feature not only streamlines your formulas but also enhances the readability and organization of your spreadsheets. Let’s see how named ranges work and explore their practical applications through an example.\n\n1.9.1 Creating Named Ranges\nTo create a named range in Excel, follow these simple steps:\n\nSelect the Cells: Highlight the cell or range of cells you want to name.\nName the Range: Go to the “Formulas” tab on the ribbon, click on “Define Name,” and enter your desired name for the range.\nConfirm: Click “OK” to save the named range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe fastest way to create a name is to use the Name box (to the left of the Formula bar). Select the cell or range to name, click the Name box, and type the name. Press Enter to create the name.\n\n\n\n\n1.9.2 Advantages of Named Ranges\n\nReadability: Instead of referring to cells by their coordinates (e.g., A1:B10), you can use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the data.\nEase of Use: A meaningful range name (such as Hb_level) is much easier to remember than a range address\nFlexibility: They make your spreadsheet more dynamic as named ranges automatically adjust when you insert or delete rows and columns.\n\n\n\n1.9.3 Example\nSuppose you have the following data:\n\nInstead of referencing cell ranges directly in your formulas, you can name the ranges for better clarity. Let’s name cell range A2:A7 as “names” and B2:B7 as “height”\n\nDefine Named Ranges:\n\nnames: =$A$2:$A$7\nheight: =$B$2:$B$7\n\n\nNow, to calculate the average heights, you can simply use the formula:\n=AVERAGE(height)",

    "text": "1.10 Tables\nTables in Excel are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing data efficiently. With their flexibility and functionality, tables can significantly enhance your data management capabilities. In this section, we’ll see how to add a table, sorting and filtering data within a table, and changing the appearance of tables in Excel.\n\n1.10.1 Adding a Table:\nAdding a table in Excel is a straightforward process:\n\nSelect Your Data: Highlight the range of cells containing your data. This can include headers if your data has them.\nInsert a Table: Navigate to the “Insert” tab on the Excel ribbon. Click on the “Table” button. Excel will automatically detect the range of cells you selected and prompt you to confirm it. Ensure the “My table has headers” option is checked if your data includes headers.\nCustomize Your Table: After inserting the table, you can modify its design and structure using the “Table Design” tab that appears when the table is selected. Here you can change the table style, add or remove columns, and make other adjustments to suit your preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + T to insert a table from the selected range of cells.\n\n\n\n\n1.10.2 Sorting and Filtering Data:\nOnce you’ve created a table, sorting and filtering data becomes incredibly efficient:\n\nSorting Data: To sort data within a table, simply click on the dropdown arrow in the header of the column you want to sort by. Choose either “Sort A to Z” or “Sort Z to A” based on your preference. Excel will instantly rearrange the rows according to your selection.\nExample: Suppose you have a table of data about basic details of people with columns for “Name”, “Age”, and “Sex”. You can sort the table by “Age” in descending order to see the oldest people at the top.\nFiltering Data: Filtering allows you to display only specific rows of data based on criteria you define. Click on the dropdown arrow in the header of the column you want to filter. You can then select specific values to display or use custom filter options for more complex filtering conditions.\nExample: In a table containing patients information, you can filter the “Department” column to show only patient from the “Cardiology” department.\n\n\n\n1.10.3 Naming a Table\nAssigning names to tables in Excel is a straightforward process, yet its implications are profound.\n\nSelect the Table: Begin by selecting the range of cells that constitute your table.\nNavigate to the ‘Table Design’ Tab: Once your table is selected, navigate to the ‘Table Design’ tab on the Excel ribbon. Here, you’ll find a Table Name option.\nEnter a Name: Below the Table Name option, there is a textbox where you can enter the name for the table. Give the table a name and press “Enter”.\n\n\n\n1.10.4 Changing Appearance:\nThe “Table Design” tab offers a range of predefined table styles that you can apply with a single click. These styles include different colors, fonts, and formatting options. If you are not happy with any of the built-in Excel table styles, you can create your own table style from New Table Style option underneath the predefined styles.\nExperiment with the features to discover the full potential of tables in Excel for your specific needs.",

    "text": "1.12 Conditional Formatting\nConditional formatting in Excel is a powerful tool that allows you to visually highlight and format cells based on specific conditions. Whether you’re a data analyst, program manager, or a student, understanding how to utilize conditional formatting can significantly enhance the readability and analysis of your Excel spreadsheets. In this section, we’ll see the various aspects of conditional formatting including graphical conditional formats and creating formula-based rules.\n\n1.12.1 Specifying Conditional Formatting:\nTo specify conditional formatting in Excel, follow these simple steps:\n\nSelect the Range: Begin by selecting the range of cells you want to apply conditional formatting to.\nAccess the Conditional Formatting Menu: Navigate to the “Home” tab on the Excel ribbon, then click on the “Conditional Formatting” dropdown menu located in the “Styles” group.\nChoose a Formatting Rule: From the dropdown menu, select the type of conditional formatting rule you want to apply. Excel offers a variety of predefined rules such as highlighting cells that contain specific text, dates, or values, as well as rules based on comparison operators.\nSpecify Conditions: Define the conditions under which the formatting should be applied. This could involve setting threshold values, text criteria, date ranges, or custom formulas.\nSet Formatting Options: After selecting the rule type, configure the formatting options according to your preferences. This may include choosing font color, cell fill color, font style, borders, and more.\nApply and Review: Once you’ve set up the formatting rule, click “OK” to apply it to the selected range. Review the changes to ensure they meet your expectations.\n\n\n\n1.12.2 Using Graphical Conditional Formats:\nExcel provides several graphical conditional formats that offer visually appealing ways to represent your data. Some popular graphical formats include:\n\nData Bars: Data bars add horizontal bars to cells proportional to their values. This makes it easy to visually compare values across a range of cells.\nColor Scales: Color scales apply a gradient of colors to cells based on their values. For example, you can use a green-yellow-red color scale to highlight high, medium, and low values in your dataset.\nIcon Sets: Icon sets display icons (such as arrows, shapes, or symbols) in cells based on predefined criteria. For instance, you can use arrow icons to indicate whether values are increasing, decreasing, or staying the same.\n\n\n\n1.12.3 Formula-Based Rules:\nFormula-based conditional formatting allows you to create custom rules using Excel formulas. This provides flexibility in defining conditions for formatting. Here’s an example of how to create a formula-based rule:\nExample: Highlighting Cells with Values Greater Than Average\n\nSelect the Range: Choose the range of cells you want to format.\nAccess Conditional Formatting: Go to the “Conditional Formatting” menu and select “New Rule.”\nChoose a Rule Type: Select “Use a formula to determine which cells to format.”\nEnter the Formula: In the formula box, enter a formula that defines the condition. For this example, the formula could be =A1&gt;AVERAGE(A:A) assuming the data is in column A.\nSet Formatting: Specify the formatting options you want to apply to cells that meet the condition.\nApply and Review: Click “OK” to apply the rule and review the changes in your spreadsheet.",

    "section": "1.13 Relative and Absolute Cell Referencing",
    "text": "1.13 Relative and Absolute Cell Referencing\nThere are two types of cell references: relative and absolute. Relative and absolute references behave differently when copied and filled to other cells. Relative references change when a formula is copied to another cell. Absolute references, on the other hand, remain constant no matter where they are copied.\nRelative: The row and column references can change when you copy the formula to another cell because the references are actually offsets from the current row and column. By default, Excel creates relative cell references in formulas.\nAbsolute: The row and column references don’t change when you copy the formula because the reference is to an actual cell address. An absolute reference uses two dollar signs in its address: one for the column letter and one for the row number (for example, $A$5).\nMixed: Either the row or the column reference is relative, and the other is absolute. Only one of the address parts is absolute (for example, $A4 or A$4).\nThe type of cell reference is important only if you plan to copy the formula to other cells.\n\n1.13.1 Example\n\nRelative Cell Referencing: In the given example, if we’re calculating the Total for each project, the formula for Project A’s Total might be =SUM(B2:E2). When this formula is copied to the row below for Project B, Excel automatically adjusts the formula to =SUM(B3:E3). This adjustment is because Excel sees that the formula has been moved down by one row, so it updates the row references accordingly. This behavior is known as relative cell referencing.\nAbsolute Cell Referencing: Now, let’s say we want to calculate the percentage of each project’s total compared to the grand total. To do this, we might use a formula like =F2/$F$5 for Project A’s percentage. The $ signs before the row and column in $F$5 make the reference absolute. When you copy this formula to other rows, the reference to cell F5 will remain unchanged. This is useful when you want a specific cell reference to stay constant, such as when referencing a grand total or a fixed value.\nIn summary, relative cell referencing adjusts the reference based on the position of the formula when copied, while absolute cell referencing keeps the reference constant regardless of where the formula is copied.",

You have to correct the formula (or correct a cell that the formula references) to get rid of the error display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Value\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n#DIV/0!\nThe formula is trying to divide by zero. Because Excel applies a value of 0 to empty cells, this error also occurs when the formula attempts to divide by a cell that is blank or has a value of 0.\n\n\n#NAME?\nThe formula uses a name that Excel doesn’t recognize. This can happen if you delete a name that’s used in the formula, if you misspell a name and then hit Enter, or if you have unmatched quotes when using text.\n\n\n#N/A\nThe formula is referring (directly or indirectly) to a cell that uses the NA function to signal that data is not available. For instance, the following formula returns an #N/A error if the A1 is empty: =IF(A1=““, NA(), A1) Some lookup functions (for example, VLOOKUP and MATCH) can also return #N/A when they do not find a match.\n\n\n#NULL!\nThe formula uses an intersection of two ranges that don’t intersect. (This concept is described later in the chapter.)\n\n\n#NUM!\nA problem with a value exists; for example, you specified a negative number as an argument where a positive number is required.\n\n\n#REF!\nThe formula refers to a cell that isn’t valid.

    "text": "2.8 Calculating Percentages\nUnderstanding the proportion of individual values in relation to the total is crucial for insightful analysis. Excel simplifies this task with the following formula:\n= (Value / Total) * 100\nHere, “Value” represents the specific data point you’re interested in, and “Total” denotes the sum of all relevant values. By multiplying the quotient with 100, you obtain the percentage representation.\nFor example, suppose you have a dataset containing the number of cases of a disease for different states in a country and you want to calculate the percentage of the cases in each state out of the total cases in the country. You can use the formula =(Cases in State / Total Cases in Country) * 100 to find the percentage for each region.\nDragging this formula across the dataset will swiftly compute the percentage of cases in each state. \nAnalyzing variations between two data points is essential for detecting trends or anomalies. The formula for calculating percentage variance is:\n= ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100\nIn this formula, “New Value” signifies the updated or later data point, while “Old Value” represents the initial or previous data point. The difference between the new and old values, divided by the old value and multiplied by 100, yields the percentage variance.\nConsider a scenario where you have data on the number of cases of a disease for two consecutive years. To calculate the percentage increase in cases from one year to the next, you can use the formula =((Cases in Year 2 - Cases in Year 1) / Cases in Year 1) * 100.\nExecuting this formula provides a clear percentage representation of the case variation, indicating whether cases have increased or decreased and by what percentage.\nExercise file is available here",

    "section": "2.9 Counting Values in a Range",
    "text": "2.9 Counting Values in a Range\nExcel provides several functions to count the values in a range. They allow ypu to quickly tally up occurrences, quantify datasets, and derive valuable insights.\n\n2.9.1 COUNT() Function\nThe COUNT() function is a fundamental tool for counting numeric values within a dataset. It disregards empty cells and cells containing text or errors.\nSyntax: =COUNT(value1, [value2], ...)\nExample:\nConsider a dataset containing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in a specific area:\n\n\n\nDay\nConfirmed Cases\n\n\n\n\nDay 1\n350\n\n\nDay 2\n520\n\n\nDay 3\n\n\n\nDay 4\n430\n\n\nDay 5\nError\n\n\nDay 6\n650\n\n\n\nTo count the the total number of days with reported cases:\n=COUNT(A2:A7)\nThis formula will return 4, as there are four numeric values in the specified range.\n\n\n2.9.2 COUNTA() Function\nWhile COUNT() tallies only numeric values, COUNTA() extends its capability to count all non-blank cells, including text and errors.\nSyntax: =COUNTA(value1, [value2], ...)\nExample:\nUsing the same dataset, let’s count all non-blank cells:\n=COUNTA(A2:A7)\nThis formula will return 5, including both numeric values and the error.\n\n\n2.9.3 COUNTIF() Function\nThe COUNTIF() function is invaluable for counting cells that meet specific criteria within a dataset.\nSyntax: =COUNTIF(range, criteria)\nExample:\nSuppose we want to count the number of days confirmed cases exceeding 400:\n=COUNTIF(A2:A7, \"&gt;400\")\nThis formula will return 3, indicating there are three days in which number of daily confirmed cases were greater than 400.\n\n\n2.9.4 COUNTIFS() Function\nSimilar to COUNTIF(), COUNTIFS() extends its functionality to count cells based on multiple criteria.\nSyntax: =COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], ...)\nExample:\nConsider a scenario where we want to count the days with more than 100 cases in a specific region. We can use COUNTIFS() to achieve this by specifying both the region and the case count threshold.\n=COUNTIFS(A2:A7, \"&gt;400\", B2:B7, \"Region A\")\n\n\n2.9.5 IF() Function\nThe IF function evaluates whether a condition is met or not and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if the condition is false.\nThe syntax of the IF function is:\n=IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)\n\nlogical_test: This is the condition that you want to evaluate. It can be a logical expression, a cell reference, or another function that returns a logical value (TRUE or FALSE).\nvalue_if_true: The value that is returned if logical_test evaluates to TRUE.\nvalue_if_false: The value that is returned if logical_test evaluates to FALSE.\n\nSuppose we have a dataset containing cholesterol levels, and we want to categorize individuals as having high cholesterol if their level is greater than 240 mg/dL. We can use the IF function to create a column that identifies whether each individual has high cholesterol or not.\nExample: Assume cholesterol levels are in column A and start at row 2. In cell B2, enter the formula:\n=IF(A2 &gt; 240, \"High Cholesterol\", \"Normal Cholesterol\")\nThis formula checks if the value in cell A2 (cholesterol level) is greater than 240. If true, it returns “High Cholesterol”; otherwise, it returns “Normal Cholesterol”.\n\n\n2.9.6 IFS() Function\nIFS function extends the capabilities of the IF function by allowing you to evaluate multiple conditions and return a value corresponding to the first TRUE condition.\nThe syntax of the IFS function is:\n=IFS(condition1, value_if_true1, [condition2, value_if_true2], ...)\n\ncondition1, condition2, etc.: These are the conditions that you want to evaluate.\nvalue_if_true1, value_if_true2, etc.: These are the values that are returned if the corresponding condition is true.\n\nLet’s extend the previous example to categorize cholesterol levels into different ranges (Normal, Borderline High, High) using the IFS function.\nExample: Assume cholesterol levels are in column A and start at row 2. In cell C2, enter the formula:\n=IFS(A2 &gt; 240, \"High Cholesterol\", A2 &gt; 200, \"Borderline High Cholesterol\", A2 &gt; 0, \"Normal Cholesterol\")\nThis formula evaluates the cholesterol level in cell A2 against multiple conditions. It returns “High Cholesterol” if A2 &gt; 240, “Borderline High Cholesterol” if A2 &gt; 200 but not greater than 240, and “Normal Cholesterol” if A2 is less than or equal to 200.",

    "text": "3.3 Using Shapes\nExcel provides variety of customizable graphic images known as shapes. You can use them to display text or add some visual appearance to a worksheet.\n\n3.3.1 Inserting Shapes\n\nTo insert a shape, navigate to the “Insert” tab on the Excel ribbon. Click on the “Shapes” button located in the “Illustrations” group. A dropdown menu will appear, offering a variety of shape categories to choose from, including basic shapes, arrows, flowchart elements, and more.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve chosen a category, simply click on the desired shape to select it. Your cursor will now transform into a crosshair, allowing you to draw the shape directly onto your worksheet. Click and drag to define the size and proportions of the shape.\nExcel also allows for the insertion of custom shapes. To do this, select “Edit Shape” from the dropdown menu after clicking on a shape. Here, you can modify the shape’s vertices and curves to create a custom design tailored to your needs.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Formatting Shapes\n\nFill and Outline: After inserting a shape, you can customize its appearance using the formatting options available in the “Format Shape” pane. To access this pane, right-click on the shape and select “Format Shape” from the context menu. Here, you can adjust the fill color, outline color, and effects such as shadows and reflections.\n\n\n\nShape Styles: Excel offers a range of predefined shape styles that can be applied with a single click. These styles include variations in fill color, outline weight, and effects, allowing you to quickly achieve a polished look for your shapes.\nSize and Position: Precise control over a shape’s size and position is essential for achieving a professional layout. Use the sizing handles to adjust the dimensions of the shape, or enter specific values in the “Size & Properties” pane. To align multiple shapes, utilize the alignment tools available in the “Format” tab.\nGrouping and Layering: When working with multiple shapes, grouping them together can simplify manipulation and formatting. Select the shapes you wish to group, right-click, and choose “Group” from the context menu. Additionally, you can change the stacking order of shapes using the “Bring Forward” and “Send Backward” options.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Creating Dynamic Labels\nDynamic labels are the labels that changes with the changes in the underlying data. The below figure illustrates this. The selected text box shape is linked to cell E11 in Calculations worksheet. As the value of this cell changes, the text box displays updated value. To add dynamic labels, select the text box or shape and enter the cell reference in formula bar.",

    "text": "4.1 Cleaning Data\nData cleaning involves fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining various data sources, there are numerous chances for data duplication or misidentification. Inaccurate data can lead to unreliable results and outcomes. Since data cleaning processes differ from one dataset to another, there isn’t a singular approach to outlining precise steps. Nonetheless, it’s crucial to establish a template for your data cleaning process to ensure consistent and correct analysis everytime. In this section, we will see some data cleaning techniques which you must be familiar with.",

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nBefore cleaning your dataset, consider making a copy of your original dataset. This way, you can always revert to the original data if needed.\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Remove Duplicate Rows\nDuplicate rows can clutter your data and make analysis challenging. Excel provides powerful tools to identify and remove these duplicate entries efficiently.\n\nSelect Your Data: Begin by selecting the range of cells or the entire table from which you want to remove duplicates.\nNavigate to the Data Tab: Click on the “Data” tab in the Excel ribbon at the top of the screen.\nClick on Remove Duplicates: In the Data Tools group, locate and click on “Remove Duplicates.”\n\n\n\nChoose Columns: A dialog box will appear listing all the columns in your selected range. You can choose the columns where you want Excel to check for duplicates. By default, all columns are selected.\nDetermine Criteria: Decide whether you want Excel to consider all columns collectively or only specific columns when identifying duplicates. Check or uncheck the boxes accordingly. For example, if your data have some unique identifier (like ID Card No) then you can select that column only.\nRemove Duplicates: After setting your criteria, click “OK.” Excel will process the data and remove any duplicate rows based on your specified criteria.\n\n\n\nReview Results: Excel will display a message indicating how many duplicate values were found and removed. Click “OK” to close the message box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo visually identify duplicates before removing them, apply conditional formatting to highlight duplicate values within your dataset.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Splitting Text\nOne of the powerful features of Excel is its ability to manipulate and organize data efficiently. The “Split to Columns” function is useful when you need to separate text within cells into multiple columns based on a delimiter or a specific character. This feature can save you time and effort, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n\nSelect Your Data Range:\nFirst, make sure the column that contains the data to be split up has enough empty columns to the right to accommodate the extracted data. Select the cells that contain the text you want to split into columns. Ensure that each cell contains the text you wish to separate.\nNavigate to the Data Tab:\nGo to the Excel ribbon and click on the “Data” tab.\nChoose “Text to Columns”:\nWithin the “Data Tools” group, locate and click on “Text to Columns.” This action will launch the “Convert Text to Columns Wizard.”\n\n\n\nSelect the Delimiter:\nIn the first step of the wizard, you’ll be prompted to choose how you want to split your data. Excel gives you the option to split by delimiter (such as commas, spaces, tabs, or custom characters used to separates text items) or by fixed width. Choose the appropriate option based on your data format and click “Next.”\nSpecify Delimiter Settings (if applicable):\nIf you selected to split by delimiter, specify which delimiter Excel should use for splitting your text. You can choose from predefined delimiters like Tab, Semicolon, Comma, Space, or specify a custom delimiter. Preview the results in the Data preview window to ensure the split is as expected.\nConfigure Column Data Format (if needed):\nIn the next step, you can format each column of data. Choose the data format (General, Text, Date, etc.) for each column or keep it as is. Click “Finish” once you are satisfied with your selections.\nReview Your Split Data:\nExcel will automatically split the selected text into separate columns based on your specifications. Review the resulting columns to ensure the split was successful and meets your requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlways use the Data preview window to see how your text will be split before finalizing the operation.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Removing Extra Space\nSometimes, the data contains extra spaces. It is very difficult to spot a space character at the end of a text string. It can cause problems when you are doing analysis. For example, ‘Male’ is not same as ‘Male’. When you do analysis, there will be two variable values ‘Male’ and ‘Male’, but basically both are the same.\nTo solve this, use the TRIM() function, which removes leading and trailing spaces while condensing multiple interior spaces into a single space.\n=TRIM(text)\ntext: This is the text string from which you want to remove extra spaces.\n\n\n4.1.4 Changing the case of Text\nMostly, you need to make text in columns consistent in terms of case. Unlike Microsoft Word, Excel doesn’t provide a direct way to do it. But we can change the case using functions. The relevant functions are as follows:\n\nThe UPPER() function converts all letters in a text string to uppercase.\n\n=UPPER(text)\n\nThe LOWER() function converts all letters in a text string to lowercase.\n\n=LOWER(text)\n\nThe PROPER() function capitalizes the first letter of each word in a text string and converts all other letters to lowercase.\n\n=PROPER(text)\n\n\n4.1.5 Converting Values\nThe CONVERT() function allows you to convert a measurement from one unit to another within the same measurement category.\nThe CONVERT() function in Excel follows a specific syntax:\n=CONVERT(number, from_unit, to_unit)\n\nnumber: This is the value you want to convert.\nfrom_unit: The current unit of the value you want to convert.\nto_unit: The unit to which you want to convert the value.\n\nImagine you have a dataset containing temperature recorded in Fahrenheit (F) in cell A1, and you need to convert these weights to Celsius (C) for analysis or reporting purposes. Let’s use the CONVERT() function to do this conversion.\n=CONVERT(A1,\"F\",\"C\")\nIn this example:\n\nA1: contain the temperature reading in Fahrenheit\n“F”: represent the temperature in Fahrenheit\n“C”: indicates the desired unit for conversion(Celsius)\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Classifying Values\nOften, you may have values that need to be classified into a group. In Excel, you can classify values into groups using the IFS() function along with logical tests. The IFS() function allows you for multiple conditions to be evaluated, and based on whether the condition is true or false, return different values. This can be used effectively to create categories or groups for your data.\nSuppose you have data on the ages of participants of a survey in column A, and you want to classify these values into three groups:\n\nChild: Values less than 18\nAdult: Values between 18 and 60 (inclusive)\nElder: Values greater than 60\n\nIn an adjacent column (e.g., column B), enter the following formula in the first cell (e.g., B2) to classify the value in A2:\n=IFS(A2&lt;18,\"Child\", A2&lt;=60,\"Adult\", A2&gt;60,\"Elder\")\nYou can extend the formula down the column by dragging the cell handle. This will automatically apply the formula to all the cells in the column.\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Joining Columns\nCombining text from different columns into a single cell can be efficiently achieved using the CONCAT() or TEXTJOIN() functions.\n\nUsing CONCAT() Function\nThe CONCAT() function in Excel is used to concatenate, or join, text from different cells or ranges into one cell. It is particularly useful when you want to combine text strings without using any delimiter (a character that separates text items). You can include additional separators or formatting within the CONCAT() function to control how the text is combined (e.g., adding spaces, commas, etc.).\n=CONCAT(text1, [text2], ...)\n\ntext1: This is the first text or cell reference that you want to concatenate.\n[text2]: Additional text or cell references that you want to join.\n\nSee the example in figure below:\n\n\n\nUsing TEXTJOIN() Function\nThe TEXTJOIN() function allows you to concatenate text from a range of cells with specified delimiters (such as commas, spaces, or custom characters) between each item. This function is highly flexible and can handle situations where you need to skip empty cells or include only non-empty values.\n=TEXTJOIN(delimiter, ignore_empty, text1, [text2], ...)\n\ndelimiter: The delimiter to be used between each text item.\nignore_empty: A logical value (TRUE or FALSE) that specifies whether to ignore empty cells.\ntext1, text2, …: The text values or cell ranges that you want to concatenate.\n\nSee the example in figure below:",

    "text": "4.2 Data Validation\nData validation is a powerful feature that allows you to control what type of data can be entered into a cell. For example, you may want to limt the data entry in a particular range to whole numbers between 1 and 100. If you make an invalid entry, you can display a custom message. By setting validation criteria, you can ensure data integrity, accuracy, and consistency throughout your spreadsheets. Let’s see how to use data validation effectively.\n\n4.2.1 Specifying Validation Criteria\n\nSelecting Cells for Validation:\n\nBegin by selecting the cells where you want to apply data validation. You can select a single cell, a range of cells, or even an entire column.\n\nAccessing Data Validation:\n\nNavigate to the Data tab on the ribbon.\nClick on Data Validation in the Data Tools group.\n\nSetting Validation Rules:\n\nIn the Data Validation dialog box, choose the type of validation you want under the Settings tab.\nFor example, to allow only whole numbers between 1 and 100, select Whole number and specify the minimum and maximum values.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Types of Validation Criteria\nExcel offers several validation criteria options, including:\n\nWhole Number: Restricts input to whole numbers within a specified range.\nDecimal: Allows decimal numbers within a specified range.\nList: Limits input to items in a predefined list.\nDate: Validates input as dates within a specified period.\nTime: Validates input as times.\nText Length: Controls the length of text allowed in a cell.\nCustom: Uses a custom formula to determine if input is valid.\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Creating a Dropdown List\nDropdown lists are particularly useful for ensuring data consistency and ease of use. Here’s how to set up a dropdown list using data validation:\n\nSpecify List Items:\n\nEnter the items you want in the dropdown list in a separate column or range.\n\nSelect Cells for Dropdown:\n\nChoose the cells where you want the dropdown list to appear.\n\nSet Data Validation:\n\nAccess the Data Validation dialog box.\nChoose List under Allow.\nSpecify the source of the list using the range selector or by typing the range directly (e.g., =$E$3:$E$6).\nYou can also write the list items in Source box, each items seperated by comma.\n\n\nEnable the Dropdown:\n\nNow, the selected cells will display a dropdown arrow, allowing users to choose from the predefined list.",
