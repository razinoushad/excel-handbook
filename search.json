    "text": "1.9 Named Ranges\nNamed ranges in Excel are like shortcuts for your data. They allow you to assign a meaningful name to a specific cell or range of cells, making it easier to reference them throughout your workbook. This feature not only streamlines your formulas but also enhances the readability and organization of your spreadsheets. Let’s see how named ranges work and explore their practical applications through an example.\n\n1.9.1 Creating Named Ranges\nTo create a named range in Excel, follow these simple steps:\n\nSelect the Cells: Highlight the cell or range of cells you want to name.\nName the Range: Go to the “Formulas” tab on the ribbon, click on “Define Name,” and enter your desired name for the range.\nConfirm: Click “OK” to save the named range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe fastest way to create a name is to use the Name box (to the left of the Formula bar). Select the cell or range to name, click the Name box, and type the name. Press Enter to create the name.\n\n\n\n\n1.9.2 Advantages of Named Ranges\n\nReadability: Instead of referring to cells by their coordinates (e.g., A1:B10), you can use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the data.\nEase of Use: A meaningful range name (such as Hb_level) is much easier to remember than a range address\nFlexibility: They make your spreadsheet more dynamic as named ranges automatically adjust when you insert or delete rows and columns.\n\n\n\n1.9.3 Example\nSuppose you have the following data:\n\nInstead of referencing cell ranges directly in your formulas, you can name the ranges for better clarity. Let’s name cell range A2:A7 as “names” and B2:B7 as “height”\n\nDefine Named Ranges:\n\nnames: =$A$2:$A$7\nheight: =$B$2:$B$7\n\n\nNow, to calculate the total sales, you can simply use the formula:\n=AVERAGE(height)",

    "text": "1.10 Tables\nTables in Excel are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing data efficiently. With their flexibility and functionality, tables can significantly enhance your data management capabilities. In this section, we’ll see how to add a table, sorting and filtering data within a table, and changing the appearance of tables in Excel.\n\n1.10.1 Adding a Table:\nAdding a table in Excel is a straightforward process:\n\nSelect Your Data: Highlight the range of cells containing your data. This can include headers if your data has them.\nInsert a Table: Navigate to the “Insert” tab on the Excel ribbon. Click on the “Table” button. Excel will automatically detect the range of cells you selected and prompt you to confirm it. Ensure the “My table has headers” option is checked if your data includes headers.\nCustomize Your Table: After inserting the table, you can modify its design and structure using the “Table Design” tab that appears when the table is selected. Here you can change the table style, add or remove columns, and make other adjustments to suit your preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + T to insert a table from the selected range of cells.\n\n\n\n\n1.10.2 Sorting and Filtering Data:\nOnce you’ve created a table, sorting and filtering data becomes incredibly efficient:\n\nSorting Data: To sort data within a table, simply click on the dropdown arrow in the header of the column you want to sort by. Choose either “Sort A to Z” or “Sort Z to A” based on your preference. Excel will instantly rearrange the rows according to your selection.\nExample: Suppose you have a table of data about basic details of people with columns for “Name”, “Age”, and “Sex”. You can sort the table by “Age” in descending order to see the oldest people at the top.\nFiltering Data: Filtering allows you to display only specific rows of data based on criteria you define. Click on the dropdown arrow in the header of the column you want to filter. You can then select specific values to display or use custom filter options for more complex filtering conditions.\nExample: In a table containing patients information, you can filter the “Department” column to show only patient from the “Cardiology” department.\n\n\n\n1.10.3 Naming a Table\nAssigning names to tables in Excel is a straightforward process, yet its implications are profound.\n\nSelect the Table: Begin by selecting the range of cells that constitute your table.\nNavigate to the ‘Table Design’ Tab: Once your table is selected, navigate to the ‘Table Design’ tab on the Excel ribbon. Here, you’ll find a Table Name option.\nEnter a Name: Below the Table Name option, there is a textbox where you can enter the name for the table. Give the table a name and press “Enter”.\n\n\n\n1.10.4 Changing Appearance:\nThe “Table Design” tab offers a range of predefined table styles that you can apply with a single click. These styles include different colors, fonts, and formatting options. If you are not happy with any of the built-in Excel table styles, you can create your own table style from New Table Style option underneath the predefined styles.\nExperiment with the features to discover the full potential of tables in Excel for your specific needs.",

    "text": "1.12 Conditional Formatting\nConditional formatting in Excel is a powerful tool that allows you to visually highlight and format cells based on specific conditions. Whether you’re a data analyst, program manager, or a student, understanding how to utilize conditional formatting can significantly enhance the readability and analysis of your Excel spreadsheets. In this section, we’ll see the various aspects of conditional formatting including graphical conditional formats and creating formula-based rules.\n\n1.12.1 Specifying Conditional Formatting:\nTo specify conditional formatting in Excel, follow these simple steps:\n\nSelect the Range: Begin by selecting the range of cells you want to apply conditional formatting to.\nAccess the Conditional Formatting Menu: Navigate to the “Home” tab on the Excel ribbon, then click on the “Conditional Formatting” dropdown menu located in the “Styles” group.\nChoose a Formatting Rule: From the dropdown menu, select the type of conditional formatting rule you want to apply. Excel offers a variety of predefined rules such as highlighting cells that contain specific text, dates, or values, as well as rules based on comparison operators.\nSpecify Conditions: Define the conditions under which the formatting should be applied. This could involve setting threshold values, text criteria, date ranges, or custom formulas.\nSet Formatting Options: After selecting the rule type, configure the formatting options according to your preferences. This may include choosing font color, cell fill color, font style, borders, and more.\nApply and Review: Once you’ve set up the formatting rule, click “OK” to apply it to the selected range. Review the changes to ensure they meet your expectations.\n\n\n\n1.12.2 Using Graphical Conditional Formats:\nExcel provides several graphical conditional formats that offer visually appealing ways to represent your data. Some popular graphical formats include:\n\nData Bars: Data bars add horizontal bars to cells proportional to their values. This makes it easy to visually compare values across a range of cells.\nColor Scales: Color scales apply a gradient of colors to cells based on their values. For example, you can use a green-yellow-red color scale to highlight high, medium, and low values in your dataset.\nIcon Sets: Icon sets display icons (such as arrows, shapes, or symbols) in cells based on predefined criteria. For instance, you can use arrow icons to indicate whether values are increasing, decreasing, or staying the same.\n\n\n\n1.12.3 Formula-Based Rules:\nFormula-based conditional formatting allows you to create custom rules using Excel formulas. This provides flexibility in defining conditions for formatting. Here’s an example of how to create a formula-based rule:\nExample: Highlighting Cells with Values Greater Than Average\n\nSelect the Range: Choose the range of cells you want to format.\nAccess Conditional Formatting: Go to the “Conditional Formatting” menu and select “New Rule.”\nChoose a Rule Type: Select “Use a formula to determine which cells to format.”\nEnter the Formula: In the formula box, enter a formula that defines the condition. For this example, the formula could be =A1&gt;AVERAGE(A:A) assuming the data is in column A.\nSet Formatting: Specify the formatting options you want to apply to cells that meet the condition.\nApply and Review: Click “OK” to apply the rule and review the changes in your spreadsheet.",

    "section": "1.13 Relative and Absolute Cell Referencing",
    "text": "1.13 Relative and Absolute Cell Referencing\nThere are two types of cell references: relative and absolute. Relative and absolute references behave differently when copied and filled to other cells. Relative references change when a formula is copied to another cell. Absolute references, on the other hand, remain constant no matter where they are copied.\nRelative: The row and column references can change when you copy the formula to another cell because the references are actually offsets from the current row and column. By default, Excel creates relative cell references in formulas.\nAbsolute: The row and column references don’t change when you copy the formula because the reference is to an actual cell address. An absolute reference uses two dollar signs in its address: one for the column letter and one for the row number (for example, $A$5).\nMixed: Either the row or the column reference is relative, and the other is absolute. Only one of the address parts is absolute (for example, $A4 or A$4).\nThe type of cell reference is important only if you plan to copy the formula to other cells.\n\n1.13.1 Example\n\nRelative Cell Referencing: In the given example, if we’re calculating the Total for each project, the formula for Project A’s Total might be =SUM(B2:E2). When this formula is copied to the row below for Project B, Excel automatically adjusts the formula to =SUM(B3:E3). This adjustment is because Excel sees that the formula has been moved down by one row, so it updates the row references accordingly. This behavior is known as relative cell referencing.\nAbsolute Cell Referencing: Now, let’s say we want to calculate the percentage of each project’s total compared to the grand total. To do this, we might use a formula like =F2/$F$5 for Project A’s percentage. The $ signs before the row and column in $F$5 make the reference absolute. When you copy this formula to other rows, the reference to cell F5 will remain unchanged. This is useful when you want a specific cell reference to stay constant, such as when referencing a grand total or a fixed value.\nIn summary, relative cell referencing adjusts the reference based on the position of the formula when copied, while absolute cell referencing keeps the reference constant regardless of where the formula is copied.",

    "text": "2.6 Common Formula Errors\nSometimes when you enter a formula, Excel displays a value that begins with a hash mark (#). This is a signal that the formula is returning an error value. You have to correct the formula (or correct a cell that the formula references) to get rid of the error display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Value\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n#DIV/0!\nThe formula is trying to divide by zero. Because Excel applies a value of 0 to empty cells, this error also occurs when the formula attempts to divide by a cell that is blank or has a value of 0.\n\n\n#NAME?\nThe formula uses a name that Excel doesn’t recognize. This can happen if you delete a name that’s used in the formula, if you misspell a name and then hit Enter, or if you have unmatched quotes when using text.\n\n\n#N/A\nThe formula is referring (directly or indirectly) to a cell that uses the NA function to signal that data is not available. For instance, the following formula returns an #N/A error if the A1 is empty: =IF(A1=““, NA(), A1) Some lookup functions (for example, VLOOKUP and MATCH) can also return #N/A when they do not find a match.\n\n\n#NULL!\nThe formula uses an intersection of two ranges that don’t intersect. (This concept is described later in the chapter.)\n\n\n#NUM!\nA problem with a value exists; for example, you specified a negative number as an argument where a positive number is required.\n\n\n#REF!\nThe formula refers to a cell that isn’t valid. This can happen if the cell has been deleted from the worksheet.\n\n\n#VALUE!\nThe formula includes an argument or operand of the wrong type.

    "text": "2.8 Calculating Percentages\nUnderstanding the proportion of individual values in relation to the total is crucial for insightful analysis. Excel simplifies this task with the following formula:\n= (Value / Total) * 100\nHere, “Value” represents the specific data point you’re interested in, and “Total” denotes the sum of all relevant values. By multiplying the quotient with 100, you obtain the percentage representation.\nFor example, suppose you have a dataset containing the number of cases of a disease for different states in a country and you want to calculate the percentage of the cases in each state out of the total cases in the country. You can use the formula =(Cases in State / Total Cases in Country) * 100 to find the percentage for each region.\nDragging this formula across the dataset will swiftly compute the percentage of cases in each state. \nAnalyzing variations between two data points is essential for detecting trends or anomalies. The formula for calculating percentage variance is:\n= ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100\nIn this formula, “New Value” signifies the updated or later data point, while “Old Value” represents the initial or previous data point. The difference between the new and old values, divided by the old value and multiplied by 100, yields the percentage variance.\nConsider a scenario where you have data on the number of cases of a disease for two consecutive years. To calculate the percentage increase in cases from one year to the next, you can use the formula =((Cases in Year 2 - Cases in Year 1) / Cases in Year 1) * 100.\nExecuting this formula provides a clear percentage representation of the case variation, indicating whether cases have increased or decreased and by what percentage.\nExercise file is available here",

    "text": "2.9 Counting Values in a Range\nExcel provides several functions to count the values in a range. They allow ypu to quickly tally up occurrences, quantify datasets, and derive valuable insights.\n\n2.9.1 COUNT() Function\nThe COUNT() function is a fundamental tool for counting numeric values within a dataset. It disregards empty cells and cells containing text or errors.\nSyntax: =COUNT(value1, [value2], ...)\nExample:\nConsider a dataset containing the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in a specific area:\n\n\n\nDay\nConfirmed Cases\n\n\n\n\nDay 1\n350\n\n\nDay 2\n520\n\n\nDay 3\n\n\n\nDay 4\n430\n\n\nDay 5\nError\n\n\nDay 6\n650\n\n\n\nTo count the the total number of days with reported cases:\n=COUNT(A2:A7)\nThis formula will return 4, as there are four numeric values in the specified range.\n\n\n2.9.2 COUNTA() Function\nWhile COUNT() tallies only numeric values, COUNTA() extends its capability to count all non-blank cells, including text and errors.\nSyntax: =COUNTA(value1, [value2], ...)\nExample:\nUsing the same dataset, let’s count all non-blank cells:\n=COUNTA(A2:A7)\nThis formula will return 5, including both numeric values and the error.\n\n\n2.9.3 COUNTIF() Function\nThe COUNTIF() function is invaluable for counting cells that meet specific criteria within a dataset.\nSyntax: =COUNTIF(range, criteria)\nExample:\nSuppose we want to count the number of days confirmed cases exceeding 400:\n=COUNTIF(A2:A7, \"&gt;400\")\nThis formula will return 3, indicating there are three days in which number of daily confirmed cases were greater than 400.\n\n\n2.9.4 COUNTIFS() Function\nSimilar to COUNTIF(), COUNTIFS() extends its functionality to count cells based on multiple criteria.\nSyntax: =COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], ...)\nExample:\nConsider a scenario where we want to count the days with more than 100 cases in a specific region. We can use COUNTIFS() to achieve this by specifying both the region and the case count threshold.\n=COUNTIFS(A2:A7, \"&gt;400\", B2:B7, \"Region A\")\n\nExcel enables you to enter flexible formulas that use the values (or even text) in cells to calculate a result. When you enter a formula into a cell, the formula’s result appears in the cell.
