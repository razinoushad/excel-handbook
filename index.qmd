# Preface {.unnumbered}

This handbook is for public health professionals and researchers who want to use Excel more effectively in their work. It focuses on practical tasks like organizing data, using basic formulas, and creating simple charts without going too deep into complex features.

The aim is to keep things clear and easy to follow. Many functions are explained in a simplified way, so that even those with limited experience can understand and apply them confidently.

You can explore the handbook online at https://razinoushad.github.io/excel-handbook/, where all examples and files are available.

I hope this guide helps you use Excel more comfortably in your public health work.
