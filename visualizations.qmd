# Creating Visuals

Data visualization is a graphical representation of data. It can transform your raw data into meaningful visual stories and identify trends faster. It also helps in communicating complex information effectively.

This chapter provides a walk through of Excel's fundamental visualization capabilities. Rather than going deeply into in depth details, we aim to make you confident in navigating menu options independently. We assume that you know what you want, and just require guidance on execution. For a comprehensive understanding of visualization principles, we strongly suggest referring a good general visualization book. Our recommendation is [The Truthful Art](https://amzn.in/d/45SLf1n) by Albert Cairo. It doesn't teach the mechanics of creating visualizations, but instead focuses on what you need to think about in order to create effective graphics.

2.  Once you've chosen a category, simply click on the desired shape to select it. Your cursor will now transform into a crosshair, allowing you to draw the shape directly onto your worksheet. Click and drag to define the size and proportions of the shape.

3.  Excel also allows for the insertion of custom shapes. To do this, select "Edit Shape" from the dropdown menu after clicking on a shape. Here, you can modify the shape's vertices and curves to create a custom design tailored to your needs.

### Formatting Shapes

To align multiple shapes, utilize the alignment tools available in the "Format" tab.

4.  **Grouping and Layering:** When working with multiple shapes, grouping them together can simplify manipulation and formatting. Select the shapes you wish to group, right-click, and choose "Group" from the context menu. Additionally, you can change the stacking order of shapes using the "Bring Forward" and "Send Backward" options.

### Creating Dynamic Labels

Dynamic labels are the labels that changes with the changes in the underlying data. The below figure illustrates this. The selected text box shape is linked to cell E11 in Calculations worksheet. As the value of this cell changes, the text box displays updated value. To add dynamic labels, select the text box or shape and enter the cell reference in formula bar.
